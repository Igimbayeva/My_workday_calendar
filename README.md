# My_workday_calendar

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application designed to help users efficiently manage their workday schedules. This web-based tool allows users to plan and organize tasks for each hour of a typical working day (9 am to 5 pm). 
The application features a user-friendly interface with dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and DayJs.

Key Features:

Dynamic Time Blocks: Time blocks are dynamically generated for each hour of the working day, providing users with dedicated sections to input and save their tasks.

Color-Coded Interface: The time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether a specific hour is in the past, present, or future. This visual cue helps users quickly identify and prioritize their tasks.

User Input and Storage: Users can enter their tasks directly into the text area within each time block. The application uses local storage to persistently save and retrieve user-entered data, ensuring that tasks are not lost even when the page is refreshed.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

How to Use:

Open the Work Day Scheduler in your web browser.
The current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar.
Time blocks for standard business hours (9 am to 5 pm) will be presented, color-coded to indicate their temporal status.
Click into a time block to enter an event/task.
Click the save button for that time block to save the entered event in local storage.
The saved events persist even after refreshing the page.
This project aims to provide users with a convenient and intuitive tool for daily planning, helping them stay organized and manage their time effectively. Whether you have a busy work schedule or want to enhance your productivity, the Work Day Scheduler is designed to meet your scheduling needs.
